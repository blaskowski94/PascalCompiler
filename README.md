#DESCRIPTION
This project is a Scanner for the Mini-Pascal language, written in Java and using JFlex.

The program can be run from the command line by compiling all the .java files with javac and then running:

java ScannerMain input.txt

where input.txt is any text file that you wish to parse. The program will print out the type and lexeme of every token it finds in the text file as defined in the grammar of Mini-pascal. See the SDD for the grammar, a list of keywords and a list of symbols that are recognized.
