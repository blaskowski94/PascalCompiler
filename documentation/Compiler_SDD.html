<h3><u>Introduction</u></h3>

<p>
    Eventually, this will be a complete compiler to turn Mini-Pascal code into MIPS assembly code. For now, the program
    has a scanner, parser, syntax tree and symbol table. I have used JFlex to define lexical rules and create a scanner.
    JFlex takes in a particular language and grammar defined by the user with regular expressions and converts it into
    java source code. The scanner is designed to scan our modified version of Mini-pascal. It will take in a text file
    and output tokens to be used later in the actual compiler.
</p>

<p>
    I have also created a parser based on the grammar which can be found in the design section. The parser ensures that
    the tokens appear in an order that is valid according to the grammar. The parser is also integrated with a symbol
    table and builds a syntax tree as it parses. This keeps track of all the symbols declared such as the program name,
    variable names, function names, etc. and ensures there are no duplicates. The parser/symbol table do not yet deal
    with scope. For the time being we only deal with the global scope and assume there can not be two symbols with the
    same name. We will deal with scope in future implementations. The syntax tree that is build is currently printed out
    for a visual representation of the program. This tree will later be traversed for the code generation.
</p>

<h3><u>Design</u></h3>

<p>
    The design is gradually getting more complex. See Figure 1 for a UML diagram. There will
    be a scanner.flex file that contains the JFlex code. I will then run this code through JFlex to generate a
    MyScanner.java file. The scanner will properly parse all but invalid inputs file. When the scanner encounters errors
    it will display an error message and exit the program.
</p>

<p>
    There will also be Token.java and Type.java classes. Token defines a Token object which contains a string with the
    actual lexeme and a Type. The Type is an enumerated type defined in the Type class. There is a Type for each
    keyword, symbol as well as types for ID and number. See below for a list of symbols and keywords in Mini-pascal.
</p>

<p>The scanner will recognize the following keywords and symbols:</p>

<u>KEYWORDS</u>

<ol>
    <li>and</li>
    <li>array</li>
    <li>begin</li>
    <li>div</li>
    <li>do</li>
    <li>else</li>
    <li>end</li>
    <li>function</li>
    <li>if</li>
    <li>integer</li>
    <li>mod</li>
    <li>not</li>
    <li>of</li>
    <li>or</li>
    <li>procedure</li>
    <li>program</li>
    <li>real</li>
    <li>then</li>
    <li>var</li>
    <li>while</li>
</ol>

<u>SYMBOLS</u>
<ol>
    <li>;</li>
    <li>,</li>
    <li>.</li>
    <li>:</li>
    <li>[</li>
    <li>]</li>
    <li>(</li>
    <li>)</li>
    <li>+</li>
    <li>-</li>
    <li>=</li>
    <li><></li>
    <li><</li>
    <li><=</li>
    <li>></li>
    <li>>=</li>
    <li>*</li>
    <li>/</li>
    <li>:=</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The lexical rules the scanner and parser follow can be found in the following document: <a
        href="Mini_Pascal_Grammar.pdf" target="_blank">The Grammar</a>
</p>

<p>
    The parser uses the scanner to advance through text token by token and determine if they are in a valid order to be
    a mini-pascal program. Every function in the parser exactly corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. It uses
    a one token lookahead to see what the next token is and make a decision on whether to call other functions or match
    tokens. It begins by calling the top level function, program, which in turn matches <b>program id ;</b> if they are
    the first three tokens in the file. If it does not see what it expects to match it throws an error and the program
    stops. After it matches these three tokens it calls the declarations function and proceeds on down the tree of
    function calls. As it parses the program, whenever it encounters a declaration of a program, function, variable,
    array or procedure, it adds that name to the symbol table along with some information about the symbol. For
    variables, the name and type (int/real) are stored. For functions, the name and return type are stored. For arrays,
    the name, type, beginning and ending index are stored. For procedures and programs, just the name is stored.
    Function/procedure arguments are just treated like variables for now and in future iterations these will be stored
    specially to deal with scope. When the program is run, the symbol table will be printed to the "program name".table
    file.
</p>

<p>
    In this current iteration of the compiler, I have integrated the syntax tree into the parser. Now, as it parses the
    program, nodes corresponding to different parts of the grammar are created and added to a tree. The top level node
    is the SyntaxTreeNode, which all the nodes inherit from. See Figure 1 for a visual depiction of all the nodes. The
    various types of nodes store different information about the parts of the program. The syntax tree will be traversed
    for code generation in future iterations. For now, a visual representation of all the information stored in the
    syntax tree is printed to the "program name".tree file.
</p>

<h3><u>Functionality</u></h3>

<p>
    To use the program to generate a syntax tree and symbol table, compile the .java files to get .class files. Run this
    from the command line or through an IDE with a text file as the first and only command line argument. The main
    function takes this file as input. The program will output the tokens recognized to standard out. Ideally this text
    file should contain a Mini-pascal program.
</p>

<p>
    The following is an example of a Mini-pascal program that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers
    recursively:
</p>

<code>

    program example(input, output);<br>
    var x, y: integer;<br>
    function gcd(a, b: integer): integer;<br>
    begin
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>if b=0 then gcd:=a</li>
        <li>else gcd:=gcd(b, a mod b)</li>
    </ul>
    end;<br>
    begin
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>read(x,y);</li>
        <li>write(gcd(x,y))</li>
    </ul>
    end.<br><br>

</code>

<p>
    To use the parser, instantiate the Parser class with either a String to parse or a file. If using a file, pass in
    true as the second argument. If using a string, pass in false as the second argument. Then call <code>program</code>
    on the parser object. If successful (it follows the syntax of mini-pascal), the .tree and .table files will be
    generated. Otherwise, you will see an error message and what token the error occurred on.
</p>

<p>
    Another way to run the program is through the CompilerMain class in the compiler package. This will eventually be
    the way to run the whole compiler but for now it has the same effect as running the parser. CompilerMain will take
    in a file as a command line argument and try to compile that file.

<h3><u>Testing</u></h3>

<p>
    For testing of the scanner, symbol table and parser I used JUnit5. The testing can be found in the test package
    inside of the corresponding parent packages. The unit tests of scanner test <code>yytext</code> and
    <code>nextToken</code> functions. The tests used several text input files that contain sample Mini-pascal
    code, plain text, a list of symbols, a list of numbers and IDs, and several incorrectly formatted items for the
    scanner to parse. The unit tests of parser test the <code>program, subprogram_declaration, declarations, statement,
    simple_expression</code> and <code>factor</code> functions. For the scanner the file "simplest.pas" is used for
    testing. For the parser the file "simple.pas" is used for testing as well as strings for testing individual
    components of the parser.
