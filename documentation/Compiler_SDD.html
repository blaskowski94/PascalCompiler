<h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>

<p>
    This program is a compiler to turn Mini-Pascal code into MIPS assembly code. The program has a scanner, parser,
    syntax tree, symbol table, performs code folding and generates MIPS assembly. I have used JFlex to define lexical
    rules and create a scanner. JFlex takes in a particular language and grammar defined by the user with regular
    expressions and converts it into java source code. The scanner is designed to scan our modified version of
    Mini-pascal. It will take in a text file and output tokens to be used later in the parser. The entire program was
    developed using IntelliJ IDEA 2017.1.2 and Java version 1.8.0_101 (Java 8).
</p>

<p>
    I have also created a parser based on the grammar which can be found in the design section. The parser ensures that
    the tokens appear in an order that is valid according to the grammar. The parser is also integrated with a symbol
    table and builds a syntax tree as it parses. This keeps track of all the symbols declared such as the program name,
    variable names, function names, etc. and ensures there are no duplicates. The syntax tree that is built this has
    code folding performed on it to optimize compilation. The folded syntax tree is then traversed to generate the
    assembly code.
</p>

<h2><u>Design</u></h2>

<p>
    The program is divided up in to seven main modules. See Figure 7 for a UML diagram detailing the classes in all the
    packages.
</p>

<h4>Scanner</h4>
<p>
    The first module is the scanner. There is a scanner.flex file that contains the JFlex code. I ran this
    code through JFlex to generate the MyScanner.java file. The scanner will properly parse all but invalid input files.
    When the scanner encounters errors it will display an error message and try to continue compilation. Also inside the
    scanner module there are Token.java and Type.java classes. Token defines a Token object which contains a
    string with the actual lexeme and a Type. The Type is an enumerated type defined in the Type class. There is a Type
    for each keyword, symbol as well as types for ID and number. See below for a list of symbols and keywords in
    Mini-pascal. Also see Figure 1 for the UML diagram of this package.
</p>

<p>The scanner will recognize the following keywords and symbols:</p>

<u>KEYWORDS</u>

<ol>
    <li>and</li>
    <li>array</li>
    <li>begin</li>
    <li>div</li>
    <li>do</li>
    <li>else</li>
    <li>end</li>
    <li>function</li>
    <li>if</li>
    <li>integer</li>
    <li>mod</li>
    <li>not</li>
    <li>of</li>
    <li>or</li>
    <li>procedure</li>
    <li>program</li>
    <li>real</li>
    <li>then</li>
    <li>var</li>
    <li>while</li>
</ol>

<u>SYMBOLS</u>
<ol>
    <li>;</li>
    <li>,</li>
    <li>.</li>
    <li>:</li>
    <li>[</li>
    <li>]</li>
    <li>(</li>
    <li>)</li>
    <li>+</li>
    <li>-</li>
    <li>=</li>
    <li><></li>
    <li><</li>
    <li><=</li>
    <li>></li>
    <li>>=</li>
    <li>*</li>
    <li>/</li>
    <li>:=</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The lexical rules the scanner and parser follow can be found in the following document: <a
        href="Mini_Pascal_Grammar.pdf" target="_blank">The Grammar</a>
</p>

<h4>Parser/Semantic Analysis</h4>
<p>
    The parser uses the scanner to advance through text token by token and determine if they are in a valid order to be
    a mini-pascal program. Every function in the parser exactly corresponds to a production rule in the grammar. It uses
    a one token lookahead to see what the next token is and make a decision on whether to call other functions or match
    tokens. It begins by calling the top level function, program, which in turn matches <b>program id ;</b> if they are
    the first three tokens in the file. If it does not see what it expects to match it displays an error message with a
    line number and the program tries to continue compilation. After it matches these three tokens it calls the
    declarations function and proceeds on down the tree of function calls. The parser also performs semantic analysis as
    it traverses the program. The types of semantic analysis performed are: making sure all variables are declared
    before they are used, ensuring every expression has a type (real/integer), ensuring that types match across
    assignments and ensuring the arguments passed to function calls match the expected types. For all the semantic
    analysis, integers are promoted to reals. However, if a real is assigned to an integer or passed to a function when
    an integer is expected, an error will be thrown. See Figure 2 for the UML diagram of this package.
</p>

<h4>Symbol Table</h4>
<p>
    As the parser traverses the program, whenever it encounters a declaration of a program, function, variable, array or
    procedure, it adds that name to the symbol table along with some information about the symbol. For variables, the
    name and type (integer/real) are stored. For functions, the name, list of argument types, a local symbol table and
    return type are stored. For arrays, the name, type, beginning and ending index are stored. For procedures and
    programs, just the name is stored. To deal with scope, the function arguments and any variables declared inside the
    function are stored in the local symbol table. The entire symbol table is actually a stack of hash maps, which use a
    string name as a key and a symbol object as the value. The symbol object is an internal class inside symbol table
    that defines what data to store for each entry in the symbol table. To deal with scope, the local symbol tables are
    pushed and popped off the stack of symbol tables depending on where the parser is in the program. This allows the
    program to access local variables or global variables within function/procedure scores and only global variables in
    the global scope. To handle return values of functions, a new VariableNode with the same name and type as the
    function is added to the local symbol table of that function at the time the function is declared. Thus, the return
    values of the function should be assigned to the name of the function at some point in the function declaration.
    When the program is run, the symbol table will be printed to the "program name".table file. This is simply a text
    file. See Figure 3 for the UML diagram of this package.
</p>

<h4>Syntax Tree</h4>
<p>
    The syntax tree has been integrated into the parser. Now, as it parses the program, nodes corresponding to different
    parts of the grammar are created and added to a tree. The top level node is the SyntaxTreeNode, which all the nodes
    inherit from. The various types of nodes store different information about the parts of the program. The syntax tree
    created will later be traversed for code generation. A visual representation of all the information stored in the
    syntax tree is printed to the "program name".tree file when the compiler is run. Special nodes have been created for
    the built in read and write functions of the mini-pascal language. These functions take in input from or display
    input to the console respectively. See Figure 4 for the UML diagram of this package.
</p>

<h4>Code Folding</h4>
<p>
    Code folding is performed on the syntax tree generated. This helps improve the efficiency of the program by
    evaluating expressions in the higher level language before they are converted to assembly code. This results in
    easier code generation and more efficient assembly. Code folding works by evaluating any expressions possible before
    function/procedure calls, variable assignments or array index access. Examples would include the following:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>array[4+5+6] would be folded to array[15]</li>
    <li>calculate(4*5, 6-3) would be folded to calculate(20, 3)</li>
    <li>var := 10*2 would be folded to var := 20</li>
</ul>

<p>
    Code folding works by traversing the syntax tree generated by the parser and looking for expressions. If the
    OperationNode contains values, it performs the designated operation and updates the tree. The result of running the
    code folding is a new Syntax Tree. Code folding is run after the original syntax tree is generated. Only the folded
    tree is actually saved to the "program name".tree file. See Figure 5 for the UML diagram of this package.
</p>

<h4>Code Generation</h4>

<p>
    The final module in the compiler is the code generation. This is the package that actually handles the generation of
    MIPS assembly code. This works by traversing the folded syntax tree and writing the appropriate MIPS assembly
    commands to carry out the instructions of the original mini-pascal code. A new CodeGeneration object is created with
    the Syntax Tree and Symbol Table from the parser passed into it and generateCode() is called. This begins a
    traversal of the tree, generating a string of assembly code as it goes. When variables are declared, their memory
    address is added to the symbol table to deal with scope. Variables in the global scope are written to the .data
    section and local variables/arguments for functions/procedures are handled in a special way by pushing them to the
    stack at the appropriate time. The global variables will simply have their name as their memory address for
    reference from the .data section while local variables and function/procedure arguments will have their offset from
    the stack pointer as their memory address, for example: 4($sp). Both read and write have been implemented, so text
    can be displayed to and input can be read from the console. To ensure no overwriting of registers, only $s registers
    are used. Also, all eight $s registers ($s0-$s7) are pushed and popped to and from the stack at the beginning and
    end of every function call, including main. To handle functions, the frame pointer is used, $fp. The old value of
    the stack pointer is assigned to the frame pointer before going into a function call. This allows us to push all the
    $s registers and then store the local variables as offsets of the stack. Then, at the end of the function, we move
    the value of the frame pointer back to the stack pointer to resume the running of the program. If and while
    statements have been implemented and work as expected as well as all the basic operations. Note that "and" and "or"
    are bitwise operations. Our version of mini-pascal treats 0 as false and 1 as true. See Figure 6 for the UML diagram
    of this package.
</p>

<p>
    Note: The implementation of code generation is limited. Functions and procedures have been implemented, including
    recursion. However, real numbers and arrays have not yet been implemented. The code generation also does not handle
    nested functions (functions defined within functions). Everything up to the code generation handles all of these
    features.

<h3><u>Functionality</u></h3>

<p>
    To use this compiler to compile a mini-pascal program, use the .jar file in the "product" folder. Run from the
    command line using "java -jar compiler.jar input.pas". Alternatively, clone the BitBucket repository and open it as
    a project in IntelliJ or another Java IDE. Run the "CompilerMain" file in the compiler package with your mini-pascal
    file as the only command line argument. To then run the generated assembly code, localed the "program name".asm file
    generated, which should be localed in the same directory as the .jar was run from. Open this file in QtSpim, which
    can be downloaded <a href="http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">here</a> and click the run button.
    Note that a .table and .tree file will also be generated along with the .asm file in the same directory for
    reference. This sample .pas file and others can be found in the pascalfiles package within the src folder. See the
    user guide PDF located in the product folder for additional use information.
</p>

<p>
    The following is an example of a Mini-pascal program that calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers
    recursively:
</p>

<code>

    program example;<br>
    var x, y: integer;<br>
    function gcd(a, b: integer): integer;<br>
    begin
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>if b=0 then gcd:=a</li>
        <li>else gcd:=gcd(b, a mod b)</li>
    </ul>
    end;<br>
    begin
    <ul style="list-style: none;">
        <li>read(x);</li>
        <li>read(y);</li>
        <li>write(gcd(x,y))</li>
    </ul>
    end.<br><br>

<h3><u>Testing</u></h3>

<p>
    For testing of the scanner, symbol table, parser and code folding I used JUnit5. The testing can be found in the
    test package inside of the corresponding parent packages. The unit tests of scanner test <code>yytext</code> and
    <code>nextToken</code> functions. The tests used several text input files that contain sample Mini-pascal
    code, plain text, a list of symbols, a list of numbers and IDs, and several incorrectly formatted items for the
    scanner to parse. The unit tests of parser test the <code>program, subprogram_declaration, declarations, statement,
    simple_expression</code> and <code>factor</code> functions. For the scanner the file "simplest.pas" is used for
    testing. For the parser the file "simple.pas" is used for testing as well as strings for testing individual
    components of the parser. For testing the code generation, the files in the pascalfiles package were used.
